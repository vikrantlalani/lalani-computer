        "For the last decade, everyone was told to 'move everything to the cloud.' But in 2026, companies are realizing the truth: monthly cloud subscription fees for heavy, constant workloads are exorbitant. For predictable, heavy data lifting—like ERP systems, large databases, or video archiving—an on-premise enterprise server pays for itself in less than 18 months.",
